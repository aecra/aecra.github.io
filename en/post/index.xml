      <description>What is GDB？ GDB is the GNU Project debugger that allows you to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on &amp;ldquo;inside&amp;rdquo; another program while it&amp;rsquo;s executing &amp;ndash; or what another program was doing when it crashed.&#xA;There are four main things GDB can do (plus other things to support them) to help you catch errors on the fly:&#xA;Start the program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

      <description>Description First of all, if you use Ctrl + C to force termination during the build of Podman, the containers in the build will be left in Podman, which will not only take up space but also affect the deletion of useless images.&#xA;There were forced interruptions on many previous builds, so my problem was more serious before I discovered it, otherwise one or two images that could not be deleted would not have attracted attention.</description>

      <description>Why should we build our own gateway？ First of all, to clarify the purpose of the gateway, I use the gateway completely to unifiedly manage the various background interfaces. Before building my own gateway my background interfaces are very scattered, some are deployed on the HTTP event trigger of the cloud function, some are deployed on the Web cloud function of the cloud function, some are on the API gateway of Tencent cloud, some are on the nginx proxy.</description>

      <description>PHP offers three different APIs to connect to MySQL. These are the mysql(removed as of PHP 7), mysqli, and PDO extensions.&#xA;The mysql_ functions used to be very popular, but their use is not encouraged anymore. The documentation team is discussing the database security situation, and educating users to move away from the commonly used ext/mysql extension is part of this (check php.internals: deprecating ext/mysql).&#xA;And the later PHP developer team has taken the decision to generate E_DEPRECATED errors when users connect to MySQL, whether through mysql_connect(), mysql_pconnect() or the implicit connection functionality built into ext/mysql.</description>
