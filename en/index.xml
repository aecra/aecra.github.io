There were forced interruptions on many previous builds, so my problem was more serious before I discovered it, otherwise one or two images that could not be deleted would not have attracted attention.</description>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://static.aecra.ml/cover/build-a-gateway-by-kong.png" alt="Featured image of post Build a gateway by kong." /&gt;Why should we build our own gateway？ First of all, to clarify the purpose of the gateway, I use the gateway completely to unifiedly manage the various background interfaces. Before building my own gateway my background interfaces are very scattered, some are deployed on the HTTP event trigger of the cloud function, some are deployed on the Web cloud function of the cloud function, some are on the API gateway of Tencent cloud, some are on the nginx proxy.</description>

But I don’t want to move and backup my files frequently. So I need to find a way to mount my host files to virtual machine.
First I need to install VMware-tools to my virtual machine. With some reasons, I can’t install it autoly( The button is grey). So use the next bash command to install it.
sudo apt install open-vm-tools-desktop Then close the virtual machine.</description>

These are the mysql(removed as of PHP 7), mysqli, and PDO extensions.
The mysql_ functions used to be very popular, but their use is not encouraged anymore. The documentation team is discussing the database security situation, and educating users to move away from the commonly used ext/mysql extension is part of this (check php.internals: deprecating ext/mysql).
And the later PHP developer team has taken the decision to generate E_DEPRECATED errors when users connect to MySQL, whether through mysql_connect(), mysql_pconnect() or the implicit connection functionality built into ext/mysql.</description>
